\pkg\ is a command-line tool that enables you to import \rfwcore\ XML result
files into TestResultWebApp's database for presenting an overview about the
whole test execution and details of each test result.

\pkg\ tool requires serveral arguments, including the location of the
\href{https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#output-file}
{\rfwcore\ XML result file(s)} to parse all information of test execution result
and TestResultWebApp's database credential for importing that result.

\href{https://github.com/test-fullautomation/testresultwebapp}{TestResultWebApp}
requires some mandatory information to manage and display the test result properly.
Therefore, they should be provided in \rfwcore\ test case before execution, then
they will be available in XML result file for importing.

However, you can use optional arguments of \pkg\ tool to provide those data
if they are missing or you want to overwrite them with the expected values.

Finally, \pkg\ also allows you to append existing results in the database, which
is helpful when you need to update previous test results or add the missing
XML result file(s) from previous tool execution.
