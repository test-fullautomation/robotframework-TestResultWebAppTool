Introduce new feature to switch the access interface to TestResult's database
   
* Add supported new interface to database **REST API Access**. 

  This interface helps to import test result data to the secured server 
  which is not allowed to interact directly with the database.

* Add new optional argument ``--interface`` which allow to switch between
  available interfaces (currently only direct access).
  Its value can be:

  * ``db`` (default value): use direct access to TestResult's database.
  * ``rest``: use REST API Access to TestResult's database (new access)

* This change is transparent to end user.
